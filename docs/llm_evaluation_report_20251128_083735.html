<tr><td>SCRUM-28</td><td>User Profile Management</td><td>7</td><td>This feature directly reduces support tickets and empowers users, but has moderate security and data consistency risks. It is important but must be balanced against larger reliability goals.</td><td>Improved user autonomy and reduced support load, as users could independently update and recover profile details.Steady adoption with low regression issues, validating it as a stable, high-utility foundation feature.</td><td>https://chatgpt.com/</td><td>The STAR rationale emphasizes balancing support gains against security/data risks, yet the Feature Impact reveals minimal regression issues, suggesting the original risk assessment may have overstated downsides. This deviation highlights the value of validating assumptions through adoption metrics, reinforcing iterative risk-benefit reassessment in prioritization.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-29</td><td>Offline Mode</td><td>8</td><td>Providing offline capability addresses user pain points and improves retention, though it introduces technical complexity. Given the strategic focus on reliability and stakeholder support, it receives a higher priority.</td><td>Significantly boosted retention and session continuity in low-connectivity regions, enabling uninterrupted app use.Minor syncing conflicts surfaced initially but stabilized after patches, showing strong long-term reliability gains.</td><td>https://chatgpt.com/</td><td>The STAR Priority emphasized technical complexity as a deprioritization factor, yet the feature's successful stabilization post-launch demonstrated proactive mitigation of complexity through patches, validating the rationale's confidence in long-term gains. Learning: Balancing technical debt with user-centric outcomes requires resource allocation to ensure short-term hurdles don’t overshadow strategic value.</td></tr>
