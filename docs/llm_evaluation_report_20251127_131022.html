<tr><td>SCRUM-28</td><td>User Profile Management</td><td>6</td><td>Important for user autonomy and support reduction; security dissent reduces score, but support bias increases it; moderate overall priority 6.</td><td>Improved user autonomy and reduced support load, as users could independently update and recover profile details.Steady adoption with low regression issues, validating it as a stable, high-utility foundation feature.</td><td>https://chatgpt.com/c/69283d89-c964-8323-a8bf-9076c48485bd</td><td>The stated security dissent in the rationale did not materialize into adoption barriers, as the feature achieved steady uptake and stability despite initial concerns; this suggests security considerations may disproportionately influence priority scoring compared to real-world user behavior. The moderate 6 score underprioritized the feature’s high utility relative to impact, highlighting a learning opportunity to better balance support reduction and autonomy benefits against security risks in future prioritization models.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-29</td><td>Offline Mode</td><td>7</td><td>High value for users and retention, moderate engineering risk; strong bias pushes priority higher, but dependencies and dissent moderate risk; hence priority 7.</td><td>Significantly boosted retention and session continuity in low-connectivity regions, enabling uninterrupted app use.Minor syncing conflicts surfaced initially but stabilized after patches, showing strong long-term reliability gains.</td><td>https://chatgpt.com/c/69283d89-c964-8323-a8bf-9076c48485bd</td><td>The initial assumption of moderate engineering risk underestimated the short-term impact of syncing conflicts, which required unexpected patching efforts post-deployment. The actual impact validated the high user value and retention benefits but highlighted the need for proactive dependency management to balance risk and reward in future prioritizations.</td></tr>
