<tr><td>SCRUM-28</td><td>User Profile Management</td><td>6</td><td>Important for user autonomy and support reduction; security dissent reduces score, but support bias increases it; moderate overall priority 6.</td><td>Improved user autonomy and reduced support load, as users could independently update and recover profile details.Steady adoption with low regression issues, validating it as a stable, high-utility foundation feature.</td><td>https://chatgpt.com/c/69283d89-c964-8323-a8bf-9076c48485bd</td><td>The STAR Priority 6 underestimated the feature's foundational importance, as its actual impact demonstrated sustained high utility and stability. Learnings: Security concerns may overshadow user-centric benefits, necessitating re-evaluation of where credit/debit arise from assumptions versus outcomes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-29</td><td>Offline Mode</td><td>7</td><td>High value for users and retention, moderate engineering risk; strong bias pushes priority higher, but dependencies and dissent moderate risk; hence priority 7.</td><td>Significantly boosted retention and session continuity in low-connectivity regions, enabling uninterrupted app use.Minor syncing conflicts surfaced initially but stabilized after patches, showing strong long-term reliability gains.</td><td>https://chatgpt.com/c/69283d89-c964-8323-a8bf-9076c48485bd</td><td>The feature's retention gains validated the rationale's high user value, yet dependency risk assessments proved unnecessary as no integration issues emerged, suggesting refined mapping prioritization is critical. The syncing conflicts under normal conditions actively materialized the moderate engineering risk designation, emphasizing agile infrastructure normalization through iterative patches to maintain system stability.  <br><br>The strong bias to prioritize despite dissent risks was fully justified by the feature's decisive retention improvements, yet the prolonged initial syncing instability revealed gaps in parallel-testing depth for perceived moderate-risk features, warranting earlier failure mode simulations.</td></tr>
