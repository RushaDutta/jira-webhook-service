<tr><td>SCRUM-6</td><td>[FeatureReq] Add incognito mode</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>good customer response, increased retention</td><td>https://hoppscotch.io/</td><td>High STAR Priority (8) citing anticipated customer response and retention, yet the unsubmitted feature shows no measurable impact, revealing a disconnect between projected and realized outcomes.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-7</td><td>SCRUM-2</td><td>2</td><td>Low priority based on poor value agreement and explicit 'not wanted' synthesis summary. No competing dependencies or dissent reduce urgency, but stakeholder disinterest and lack of critical value alignment justify minimal priority.</td><td>good customer adoption, increased app usage by 17%</td><td>https://yopmail.com/en/#google_vignette</td><td></td></tr>
