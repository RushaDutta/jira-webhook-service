<tr style='background:#cacaca'><th>Jira ID</th><th>Jira Summary</th><th>STAR Priority</th><th>Priority Rationale</th><th>Feature Impact</th><th>Feature Impact Link</th><th>Reflexive Summary</th></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-25</td><td>Two-Factor Authentication</td><td>9</td><td>Security is non-negotiable, and this feature directly mitigates account compromise risks. Despite added login friction, compliance needs and brand trust override user experience concerns. The security team's bias toward risk reduction aligns with enterprise security standards, making this the highest priority.</td><td>Reduced unauthorized login attempts by 68%, improving platform security and trust.</td><td>https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0dcc27d8-13a8-4025-b9dd-a09e1dd78bf1</td><td>SCRUM-25’s STAR Priority 9 rationale emphasized compliance and brand trust but its Feature Impact solely measured security metrics, overlooking compliance adoption rates. Learning: Impact reporting must capture non-quantifiable outcomes like trust to validate holistic rationale alignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-26</td><td>Single Sign-On (SSO)</td><td>8</td><td>SSO addresses enterprise client demands, which drives sales and contract renewals. While setup complexity and IT dependency are drawbacks, the feature's alignment with enterprise growth and sales incentives elevates its priority. However, its optional adoption by smaller users reduces its universal urgency.</td><td>Increased enterprise trial conversions and reduced password reset requests, proving high business impact.</td><td>https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0dcc27d8-13a8-4025-b9dd-a09e1dd78bf1</td><td>The STAR Priority (8) emphasizes enterprise-driven sales alignment, yet Feature Impact focuses solely on trial conversions and password reduction, overlooking the noted IT dependency complexity. This highlights a gap in addressing operational feasibility trade-offs during prioritization. Learnings suggest balancing client-facing value with implementation risks to avoid overestimating adoption ease in resource-constrained environments.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-27</td><td>Multi-language Support</td><td>7</td><td>Global expansion is a leadership priority, but translation maintenance and dependency on linguistic resources introduce long-term costs. The feature's value in market diversification outweighs these challenges, placing it mid-tier for strategic alignment and scalability potential.</td><td>Very low adoption (3% usage) despite development effort and recurring maintenance overhead.</td><td>https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0dcc27d8-13a8-4025-b9dd-a09e1dd78bf1</td><td>The feature's high STAR Priority (7) and strategic rationale contrast sharply with its very low adoption (3%), revealing a gap between leadership-driven priorities and actual user engagement. This deviation underscores the importance of aligning strategic initiatives with granular market research and user validation to avoid resource-intensive efforts with minimal tangible impact.</td></tr>
