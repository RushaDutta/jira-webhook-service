<tr><td>SCRUM-6</td><td>[FeatureReq] Add incognito mode</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>good customer response, increased retention</td><td>https://hoppscotch.io/</td><td>Despite STAR priority 8 based on anticipated retention gains, incognito mode received positive customer feedback but failed to drive retention improvements, suggesting overestimated feature impact in the rationale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-7</td><td>SCRUM-2</td><td>2</td><td>Low priority based on poor value agreement and explicit 'not wanted' synthesis summary. No competing dependencies or dissent reduce urgency, but stakeholder disinterest and lack of critical value alignment justify minimal priority.</td><td>good customer adoption, increased app usage by 17%</td><td>https://yopmail.com/en/#google_vignette</td><td>Jira SCRUM-7's STAR 2 prioritization, citing poor value alignment and stakeholder disinterest, contradicts the positive 17% app usage increase and customer adoption impact.</td></tr>
