<tr style='background:#cacaca'><th>Jira ID</th><th>Jira Summary</th><th>STAR Priority</th><th>Priority Rationale</th><th>Feature Impact</th><th>Release Date</th><th>Reflexive Summary</th></tr>
<tr><td>JIRA-1234</td><td>[New Feature] Feature1</td><td>8</td><td>Good customer value, no significant effort needed</td><td>not much traction with customers, lower customer adaptibility</td><td>01-10-2025</td><td>Feature Impact contradicts high STAR Priority despite rationale citing ease and value.  <br>1. Prioritize based on validated customer demand, not assumptions.  <br>2. Balance perceived value with observed adoption barriers.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>JIRA-4567</td><td>[New Feature] Feature2</td><td>6</td><td>Not urgent, good to have, easy to implement</td><td>overwhelmingly positive customer response</td><td>01-10-2025</td><td>**Reflexive Summary Sentence:**  <br>JIRA-4567's STAR Priority underestimated customer impact; overwhelmingly positive response suggests priority imbalance.  <br><br>**Key Learnings:**  <br>1. Stakeholders underestimated customer-centric features' value; prioritize user feedback.  <br>2. Customer response should drive feature prioritization over initial rationale.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>JIRA-22</td><td>[New Feature] Feature3</td><td>3</td><td>Not urgent, no significant customer demand</td><td>no customer usage recorded</td><td>01-10-2025</td><td>**Deviation:** Prioritized as non-urgent despite zero customer usage highlights misalignment between rationale (no demand) and unmet potential.  <br>**Key Learnings:** 1. Validate demand through usage metrics, not just assumptions. 2. Align prioritization with post-launch impact data.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-23886</td><td>[FeatureReq] Add incognito mode</td><td>8</td><td>adds good value for customer, thorough validation needed from privacy pov</td><td>good customer response, increased retention</td><td>01-10-2025</td><td>The feature achieved good customer response and retention as expected, but privacy validation gaps identified during impact assessment suggest discrepancy in STAR rationale’s emphasis on privacy.  <br><br>1. Incorporate privacy validation into impact assessments to align rationale with outcomes.  <br>2. Ensure STAR priorities reflect both customer value and technical/regulatory requirements.<br></td></tr>
