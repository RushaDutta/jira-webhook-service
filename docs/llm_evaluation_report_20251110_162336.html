<tr><td>SCRUM-6</td><td>[FeatureReq] Add incognito mode</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>good customer response, increased retention</td><td>https://hoppscotch.io/</td><td>Reflexive Summary: The STAR Priority 8 rationale emphasized customer response and retention gains, aligning with the actual impact. Learning: Re-evaluating Scope and Target assumptions during implementation could prevent resource allocation gaps despite high-priority outcomes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-7</td><td>SCRUM-2</td><td>2</td><td>Low priority based on poor value agreement and explicit 'not wanted' synthesis summary. No competing dependencies or dissent reduce urgency, but stakeholder disinterest and lack of critical value alignment justify minimal priority.</td><td>good customer adoption, increased app usage by 17%</td><td>https://yopmail.com/en/#google_vignette</td><td>SCRUM-7's low STAR Priority (2) starkly contrasted with its 17% app usage increase and positive adoption, indicating stakeholder disinterest misjudged feature value. This reveals the risk of prioritizing solely on synthesis summaries, as assumed "non-critical" elements can drive unexpected outcomes, necessitating nuanced value assessments.</td></tr>
