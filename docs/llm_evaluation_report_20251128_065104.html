<tr><td>SCRUM-28</td><td>User Profile Management</td><td>8</td><td>This feature directly reduces support tickets and empowers users, providing significant operational value. Security concerns are mitigated by established audit mechanisms. The strong bias from support management aligns with business objectives, making it high priority.</td><td>Improved user autonomy and reduced support load, as users could independently update and recover profile details.Steady adoption with low regression issues, validating it as a stable, high-utility foundation feature</td><td>https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d46rieadbo4c739fr160</td><td>The rationale's emphasis on business alignment through support management bias contrasted with the impact's stronger focus on user autonomy, suggesting prioritization skewed toward operational efficiency over user-centric outcomes. RNA's mitigation of security concerns via audits appeared underemphasized in adoption metrics, indicating either miscalculated risk management or audit mechanisms being less impactful than anticipated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>SCRUM-29</td><td>Offline Mode</td><td>6</td><td>While offline mode improves user experience and retention, the engineering complexity and potential roadmap delay justify a moderate priority. The bias from reliability promotes it, but it is not as critical as immediate support ticket reduction.</td><td>Significantly boosted retention and session continuity in low-connectivity regions, enabling uninterrupted app use.Minor syncing conflicts surfaced initially but stabilized after patches, showing strong long-term reliability gains.</td><td>https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d46rieadbo4c739fr160</td><td>The STAR Priority (6) underestimated the feature's long-term impact, as the initial engineering complexity resolved quickly, enabling sustained retention gains in low-connectivity regions. The rationale's focus on roadmap delays overlooked the strategic value of stabilizing unreliable user experiences, highlighted by post-launch reliability improvements. Learnings include refining technical risk assessments and aligning priorities with user-centric outcomes rather than perceived complexity.</td></tr>
